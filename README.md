# BDA Tools for Service Professionals

As a member of Business Debtors Anonymous (BDA) working in a professional service field (mentoring, consulting, coaching), I've found my dependencies are often linked. Patterns of underearning (UE), codependency (CoDA) with clients, and workaholism can create a dangerous blur between paid work, pro bono, and personal service.

This repository is my personal effort to bring clarity to that chaos. It contains a set of principles I've developed through my BDA work to create and maintain healthy boundaries.

This is shared as one member's experience, strength, and hope. **It is not BDA conference-approved literature.** Take what you need and leave the rest.
