# The 12 Tools for Mentors, Coaches, and Consultants Navigating Pro Bono & Service

## Introduction

As service professionals in recovery, we often face a vague and dangerous line between generosity, service, marketing, and underearning. 
We may offer our expertise for "good will," only to find ourselves feeling resentful and unpaid. 
These Tools are the result of a rigorous self-investigation to bring clarity and solvency to my professional life. 
They are a personal guide to applying BDA principles in a service-based business.

***

1.  **I maintain two separate records, one for Business and one for Personal.**
    This is my foundational tool. If an activity leverages my professional skills, reputation, or network, it is tracked in my **Business** records. Everything else belongs in my **Personal** records. This creates a non-negotiable firewall that prevents the vagueness that once ruled my life.

2.  **I track my time with the same rigor as my money.**
    My time is a finite, valuable asset. I use a time-tracking system that mirrors my financial accounts (`Business` and `Personal`), ensuring that every minute is accounted for with the same honesty I apply to every dollar.

3.  **I categorize every action by its intent, not its outcome.**
    My primary measure of honesty is my true motive *at the moment of action*. A social call with a friend that unexpectedly leads to a business referral is still a personal activity. The follow-up call to discuss that referral is a business activity. This prevents me from retroactively justifying my actions.

4.  **I treat public "pro bono" work as Marketing.**
    Any professional expertise I share on a public platform or in exchange for a public review is a marketing investment, not service. It is a business-building activity, like offering "free cookies" to attract customers to my shop. I track this honestly as `Business > Growth > Marketing`.

5.  **I track all professional introductions as a Business activity.**
    My role as a "connector" is a business asset. Therefore, any introduction leveraging my professional network is a business action, tracked as `Business > Growth > Introductions`. An intro may result in a fee, or it may be a "pay it forward" marketing investment in my reputation. In all cases, its purpose and value are professional.

6.  **I define my Service as actions outside my professional domain.**
    To keep my service pure and free from ambiguity, this category is reserved for actions completely separate from my professional capacity. This includes sponsoring others in the BDA program, performing service for the fellowship (e.g., being a secretary), or helping a friend with a purely personal, non-business issue. This is tracked as `Personal > Spiritual > Service`.

7.  **I identify the "Danger Zone" of vague expectations.**
    I am aware that my disease thrives in the grey area of doing things for "good will" while secretly hoping for a return. When I feel this impulse, I recognize it as a "Danger Zone." It is a signal to pause and bookend the decision with my sponsor or another BDA member before acting.

8.  **I use "Push vs. Pull" for internal clarity, not categorization.**
    I still check if an impulse to act is a "Push" from my Higher Power or a "Pull" from my ego. This helps me act with integrity. However, I now understand that even a spiritual "Push" to perform a professional action (like an intro) is still tracked as a **Business** activity. The test informs my *motive*, not my accounting.

9.  **I acknowledge when my intent shifts.**
    I accept that the nature of an activity can change. A marketing call can spark a direct sales opportunity. I track the initial action based on its initial intent. The moment my intent shifts to pursuing a sale, any subsequent time is tracked as `Business > Business Development`. The win is in *noticing* the shift and being honest about it.

10. **I use simple, clear scripts to establish boundaries.**
    To avoid the "Danger Zone," I have simple, prepared scripts for my professional interactions. One is a clear "pay it forward" statement for intros I choose not to monetize. The other is a low-friction, professional proposal for a finder's fee. This removes emotion and ambiguity from my communication.

11. **My entire Business is a spiritual practice.**
    My goal is not to keep spirituality out of my business, but to run my entire business on a spiritual foundation of honesty, integrity, and generosity. The tracking categories are a tool for personal honesty, not a wall between my principles and my work.

12. **I carry the message, not the person.**
    I recognize that the clarity I have fought for is a gift. By documenting and sharing these principles, I carry the message of solvency to other service professionals who may be struggling with the same vagueness that once defined my own life.
